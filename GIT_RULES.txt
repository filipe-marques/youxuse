Normaly the project will have just one branch (the master branch), but can have a branch called experimental.

Branchs:

master 			(where is the stable version and currently running in the servers)
experimental 	(the pull requests should target this branch, because the development code goes here and then when its ready goes
					to master and onto production)

Instructions:

Clone the project and create a branch called test or other name where you will test the functionality you want to implement: 

git clone (url of the project on github)
cd youxuse
git checkout experimental

2 - works on the functionality you want to implement

3 - Groups small and large changes in a single commit of your contribution: 

Note: In the code comment what you did; 
Note: Test well the functionality you want to implement; 
Note: In the commit message describing what you modified: folders, files, images,...; 

git commit -m "Post what you did"

4 - You can pull to the server, doing: 
git push myfork teste 

5 - When your work was pulled to your fork, you must notify the developer of the site. This is called a pull request, and the site GitHub has a button "pull request" that automatically sends a message to the developer's account.
